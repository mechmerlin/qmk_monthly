## Firmware Updates

We have completed our first [Breaking Changes merge](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/6146). During this process we merged [11 PR's](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls?q=label%3Afuture_2019q2+) and everything seems to have gone smoothly. Particularly notable is that [LUFA is now a submodule](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6245) and [all core code is formatted by clang-format now](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6293).
