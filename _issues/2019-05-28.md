## Announcements

It’s with regret that we are announcing that Erez (u/ezuk) has decided to step back his personal involvement with QMK, and as a member/collaborator. 

Erez emailed me in late 2015 asking for assistance in using my TMK fork with the ErgoDox EZ, and volunteered to help with cleanup and documentation if we could collaborate in some way. The modifications we made, and the features we added lead us to start QMK - only the qmk_firmware repo at that time. Shortly after that, I invited u/skullydazed, and it’s since grown into quite a large project with 26 different repos (including the backend compiler, graphic configurator, toolbox, and OS hardware), 1000+ contributors (to qmk_firmware alone), tons of amazing features, and support for over 500 keyboard/project configurations. Along the way, we’ve had tremendous help from u/fredizzimo, @algernon, u/drashna, u/yanfali, u/merlin36, and u/noroadsleft as collaborators.

His company (ZSA) will continue to ship keyboards with, use, and support QMK, and they will continue sponsoring drashna’s amazing work. Erez and I have developed quite a good friendship over the years, and we will still be working together closely on the Planck EZ and other non-QMK projects in the future. Recently, Erez spear-headed the QMK Monthly, and mechmerlin has offered to take over managing it, and will be posting it to the various forums from now on.

Thanks for all of your hard work over the years,

- Jack & the QMK community

### Firmware Updates

#### RGB Changes

* Realign Hue values in RGB Light feature to use 0-255 (to use 8 bit math, and to keep in line with RGB Matrix) #[5547](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5547?w=1) by XScorpion2

This significantly reduces computational time, and improves performance for animations.

* Use static table for RGB Light’s breathing animation if a center is not defined. #[5484](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5484) - by mtei

Using a static table reduces the amount of computation needed to be done for the animation, and reduces firmware size.

* RGB Matrix animations - by XScorpion2
   * Heatmap (#[5786](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5786)) -  Keys that you hit, and adjacent keys light up based on amount of activity
   * Cycle out to in (and dual) (#[5812](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5812)) - A very hypnotic animation
   * Spirals and pinwheels (#[5877](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5877)) 
   * Single band of color left to right (#[5867](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5867))   

* Cleanup of RGB Matrix (#[5811](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5811)) by XScorpion2,  this PR makes it easier to add new effects, as well as reference the config from anywhere.  
* Add range function for RGB Light (#[5856](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5856)) by mtei

This allows for setting a range of LEDs at once. 

* Reduce RGB Matrix Firmware size (#[5919](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5919)) by XScorpion2
* Add custom center point to RGB matrix (#[5886](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5886)) by XScorpion2

This allows for offsetting the center of the matrix, so that you can have it centered in the middle of the alpha keys, rather than offset to the side of it, which will produce better animations

* Fix HSV to RGB conversion issue with saturation was 0 (#[5915](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5915)) by XScorpion2

#### Core Changes

* Add LINK_TIME_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLE option to enable LTO easily (#[5674](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5674)) by drashna

This allows for easier optimization of firmware size, and disables features that would error out when LTO is enabled, normally.

* Make Python a required build dependency (#[5784](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5784)) by skullydazed
* Fix Arch install script, to install avr-gcc 8.1.0 (#[5857](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5857)) by zvecr
* Add configurable delay to Audio Clicky feature (#[4286](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4286)) by jdmcfad
* Make delay for caps lock in Hold-Tap (Mod-Tap/Layer-Tap) function configurable (#[5497](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5497)) by drashna
* Make DEBUG keycode a toggle, rather than just enabling (#[5898](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5898)) by fauxpark
* Changed layerstate from uint32_t (32 bit unsigned integer) to a typedef, that can be configured. (#[3637](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/3637)) by alex-ong

This allows for using a smaller integer for the layer state mask, which in turn can improve the speed of keymap lookups and reduce firmware size. 

#### Split Keyboard changes

* Fix split_common i2c backlight issues (#[3886](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/3886)) by rclasen

#### Documentation

* Chinese (Mandarin) started by ymzcdg (#[5807](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5807))
* RGB Light Animation documentation overhaul (#[5813](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5813)) by yanfali
* Update to Style guide (#[5500](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5500)) by skullydazed (long live 2 spaces :’( )

### Configurator Updates

##### Printable Keymaps

Learning a new keymap and/or layout? Can’t remember what layer you put what key on? New feature this month, printout your keymaps for posterity so you can look like the expert h4k0r we all know you want to be.
