Now, let's talk some updates!

## QMK Firmware

- Audio Improvements (in case your keyboard's got a speaker):
    - Increased size of the “Note Counter” variable to allow for much longer songs (author: inev1, PR [5251](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5251), commit [73d8593](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/73d8593352b910d9fba0953b54141875f0689486?w=1), March 5th 2019)
    - Songs added: KATAWARE_DOKI, CAMPANELLA, MEGALOVANIA added (Author: DDRnJn, PR [5351](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5351), commit [fe89aef](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/fe89aef77476d76f3bfe4682b0e9c8a54c8b5329?w=1), March 11th, 2019)
    - More Songs added: MICHISHIRUBE, LIEBESLEID, MELODIES_OF_LIFE, EYES_ON_ME (Author: DDRnJn, PR [5426](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5426), Commit [fcc9b4b](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/fcc9b4b8e7eed87d25d744e3891baf878816d427?w=1), March 17th, 2019)

- Split Keyboard Common code updated to use i2c_master driver, rather than custom implementation. (author: pelrun, PR [4974](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4974), commit [37932c2](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/37932c293c15011f883a91e91ee02631ead44a2e?w=1), March 11th 2019) - one large step closer to ARM/Proton C support for Split Keyboards.
    - This change also included the ability to support over eight columns for i2c communication (serial already supported it).
    - Details on ARM support for Split Keyboards can be [found here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/4254).

- Added support for RGB LED hooked to each controller on Split Keyboards.  (Author: nooges/bakingpy/keebio, PR: [5392](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5392), commit [f077204](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/f077204fae729e66f8dfa16db82263ff2ff84d59?w=1), March 26th 2019)
    - Allows you to have a strip connected to each controller, and use i2c
    - Adds support for Serial syncing of RGB Light status
    - TODO: Syncing is not complete, and animations will get out of sync. Should be fixed by PR [5020](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5020)

- `avrdude-split-` target added for flashing eeprom and firmware for split keyboards. `avrdude-split-left` and `avrdude-split-right` exist, as well as `dfu-split-left` and `dfu-split-right`.  (PR [5414](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5414), commit [3c257c1](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/3c257c1c6e1685a2ce37951c26d13bcb8fad749d?w=1), March 15th, 2019)
- Added better detection for flashing via AVRDUDE (PR [5393](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5393), Commit [f34244a](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/f34244a871310fac4ab27f3fd75dc44626ed4eb9?w=1), March 13th 2019)
    - Specifically, it will wait for the COM port to become accessible on Linux/BSD systems, so it can actually flash the firmware properly.

- Documentation improvements by Drashna
    - Added [instructions to set up VSCode](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/other_vscode) with QMK Firmware
    - Added information about how to [set up Music Map](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_audio?id=music-mask) to remap the matrix for music mode.

- RGB improvements
    - Added Remap feature, which allows remapping the LED order, for boards like helix and crkbd. (author: mtei, PR [5243](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5243), commit[f7fd7f6](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/f7fd7f67bd1286a42326a6832627ef328252db0c?w=1), March 20th 2019)
    - Fixed an RGB Light sync issue on split common keyboard (author: Lenbok, PR [5396](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5396), commit [9c4424a](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/9c4424ae2cd86002cd2f4140eff7108212ef884e?w=1), March 17th 2019)
    - Added “single color reactive” mode for RGB Matrix (author: MatthewRobo/M-AS, PR [5330](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5330), Commit [221ac2e](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/commit/221ac2eabbc73c9d59583c6d78c779bbfec0d7bc?w=1), March 17th, 2019)
