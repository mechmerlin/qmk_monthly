# QMK Monthly Issue #8


## Announcements
* Duckle29 is now a QMK collaborator! Welcome. Duckle is the designer of the Let's Split Vitamin and a regular in the #hardware discord channel, and always helping folks out with various PCB design and firmware questions.
* Hacktoberfest was a fun and busy event. Almost 90 people qualified for T-Shirts! Thank you all for your hardwork. Congratulations to all participants and see you again next year!

## Firmware Updates

* Refactor ps2avrgb i2c ws2812 to core ([7183](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7183), by zvecr)
    * This allows the ps2avrGB boards to use the core code, rather than a custom driver.  This means that any updates to the core code will benefit all of these boards.
* Correct ARM STM32 I2C Frequency ([7080](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7080), by yiancar)
* Initial Migration of software PWM backlight ([6709](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6709), by zvecr)
* Use task driven PWM for CTPC until ARM can provide automatic configuration ([6928](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6928), by zvecr)
    * Enables/defaults to software Backlight
* Smallish overhaul of Auto-shift feature ([6067](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6067), by drashna)
    * This cleans up the code and examples, adds some additional callbacks, and addresses a few edge case issues with Auto-Shift
* Add raw write function to the OLED Driver ([7237](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7237), by splitkb)
* [Core] Add short form LTO_ENABLE ([7259](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7259), by drashna)
* Fixes USB Descriptor to identify correctly as MIDI Device ([7258](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7258), by phogy)
* CI - Fix change detection ([7038](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7038), zvecr)
* Convert Dynamic Macro to a Core Feature ([5948](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5948), drashna)
    * This converts the existing "feature" to an actual feature, without impacting the old method.
* Set `git submodule update` depth to 50 ([7269](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7269), fauxpark)
    * This fixes some issues with cloning of the repo, initially
* New and improved Lock LED callbacks ([7215](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7215), fauxpark),
    * This uses a new callback that allows the user to over-ride the keyboard level callback, so you don't get flashing or other weird artifacts. 
* ARM - ws2812 bitbang ([7173](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7173), by zvecr)
    * This adds WS2812 support for ARM, using a bit banged interface, supporting any pin on the controller.
* Support RGBLIGHT_SLEEP when ChibiOS boards suspend ([7280](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7280), bcat)
* Fix LAYER_STATE_8BIT compile issues ([7304](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7304), by zvecr)
* Unify RGB and RGBW commands ([7297](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7297), drashna)
* Fix chibiOS when mouse and nkro disabled ([7312](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7312), by zvecr)
* Remove force of debug on within RGBLIGHT - causes lockups waiting for hid_listen ([7330](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7330), zvecr)
* Add cli convert subcommand, from raw KLE to JSON ([6898](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6898), by cfbender)
* Update ARM GCC on macOS to 8.3 ([7318](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7318), by fauxpark)
* Fix shell.nix by pinning nixpkgs ([6212](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6212), by jbaum98)
* Move Ergodox EZ RGB Light code to custom driver ([7309](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7309), by drashna)
* Add support for configurable polling interval and power usage on V-USB boards ([7336](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7336), by fauxpark)
* [Core] Cleanup rules.mk for F303 keyboard ([7306](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7306), by fauxpark)
* Improvements to Solenoid feature ([7369](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7369), by drashna)
* Update slave encoder sync to reduce dropped pulses ([7325](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7325), by XScorpion2)
* Add CLI Command fox flashing a keyboard (by jorgemanzo)
* Improve a number of things about how MILC Operates ([7344](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/7344), by skullydazed)
