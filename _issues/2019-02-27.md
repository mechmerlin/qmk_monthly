title:  "QMK Monthly, Issue 1"
---

Hello, and welcome to the first issue of QMK News! Below is a brief overview of what’s new in the world of QMK, with updates covering the past month or two. Let’s get started!

## Notable New Features

* [Velocikey](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_velocikey?id=velocikey) by chrislewisdev: Control the speed of lighting effects (like the Rainbow Swirl effect) with the speed of your typing. The faster you type, the faster the lights will go!
* [Haptic feedback driver](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_haptic_feedback) by Ishtob: If your board has solenoids or a [supported haptic driver](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_haptic_feedback?id=known-supported-hardware), you can make it vibrate!
* [One Shot Key Hooks](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4967) by vosechu: Hooks added to One Shot functions, so that you can hook into the code and run custom functions (such as audio, or LED settings), to provide feedback.
* [Keyboard Initialization Hooks](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4697) by Drashna: In addition to `matrix_init_*`, `keyboard_post_init_*` and `keyboard_pre_init_*` have been added. "Pre-init" runs at the beginning before anything else is initialized, and "Post init" runs after everything else has been initialized.  This is useful for [rgblight settings on startup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/custom_quantum_functions?id=keyboard-initialization-code)
* [EEPROM (Persistent settings) for Audio on ARM systems](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4936) has been enabled by Drashna. Additional issues with ARM audio have also been corrected.
* [LED Matrix Support](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4970) by skullydazed: This is Per Key, Non-RGB (single color) LEDs. So you can control a matrix of LEDs, and provide a number of effects.
* [Debouncing overhaul](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/3720) by alex-ong: API/Framework has been added for supporting different types of debouncing.
* [Proton C conversion](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4661) by jackhumbert: Lets you easily convert your board from Pro Micro to the Proton C.

## Cleanups and fixes:

* [Unicode cleanup by Konstantin and Drashna](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4325): This was a general cleanup of the Unicode code
* Split board cleanup by mtei
* Fixed downloads for ARM boards from [https://qmk.fm/keyboards](https://qmk.fm/keyboards) (Drashna)

## Notable Changes

* [Keep pressed keys on layer state change](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/3905) by vomindoraan. Does what it says on the tin.
* [Per-key leader timing](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4026) by arkag: This makes it possible to use a shorter timeout specifically for leader keys, improving responsiveness.

## QMK Configurator Updates

Layer Tap support shipped! The UI now supports inputting the LT(layer,keycode) code.

You will find it under the Quantum keycodes tab. To simplify the UI, we’ve broken out each layer into its own code ([screenshot here](https://imgur.com/a/VnQIpeZ))

In the Keymap UI, you will [see this](https://imgur.com/a/U7ugI1R).

Drag, the keycode you want for your Tap action into the inner box.

See our [docs](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/feature_advanced_keycodes.md#switching-and-toggling-layers) for more details about this powerful QMK feature.
