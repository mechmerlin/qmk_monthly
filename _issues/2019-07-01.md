## Announcements

* Merlin renounces BMC forever and claims he was using ISO the whole time (fake news)
* [Breaking Changes](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/6146)\- We have a new process for merging changes that are risky or change behavior. The first time we run this process will be during July/August.
* We’re happy to announce that **zvecr** has joined QMK as a collaborator, we’re honored to have him. Zed has been responsible for adding a fair number of keyboards, fixing bugs and help lead infrastructure improvements in conjunction with Drashna.
