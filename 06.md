# QMK Monthly Issue #6

## Announcements
- We’d like to welcome bakingpy as our newest collaborator.  Bakingpy needs little introduction- he’s the main man behind [keebio](https://keeb.io/) and has made many improvements and contributions to QMK including split common, RGB, and QMK Toolbox.
- QMK announces the creation of the [QMK Daisy](https://imgur.com/a/TQKOJuo): 45 ml gin, 15 ml cointreau, 30 ml lime juice, 30 ml simple syrup. Shake with ice and strain. Garnish with a slice of potato. Add some fizzy water, or don’t.
- We’ve released an installable CLI that you can use to setup and work with QMK.
    - Homebrew Quickstart:
    ```
        brew tap qmk/qmk && brew install qmk && qmk setup
    ```
    - Other Platforms:
    ```
        python3 -m pip install qmk && qmk setup
    ```

## Firmware Updates

- fix unselect_rows() in quantum/matrix.c ([#6243](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6243)) by mtei changes the function to use the correct call for unselecting the matrix.
- Fix linux_install.sh script for OpenSuse v 15.1 ([#6251](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6251)) by skewwhiffy
- Add makefile rules to .editorconfig ([#6256](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6256)) by drashna - change it so that makefiles use tabs:4 rather than space:4 which causes compiler issues.
- (SpaceCadet) Added mod carry over from press to release. ([#5866](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5866)) by Xulkal/XScorpion2
- Fix chibios so the dfu-suffix is only applied once. ([#6270](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6270)) by skullydazed  - fixes dfu-suffix bug when compiling bin images.
- Use QUANTUM_LIB_SRC for i2c_master.c inclusion ([#5617](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5617)) by drashna - this allows for i2c_master.c to be included multiple times, and prevents hardware timing related issues when LTO is enabled.
- Fix debouncing issue for eager algorithms ([#6081](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6081)) by drashna
- Fixing effects to respect user sat and val levels ([#6275](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6275)) by Xulkal/XScorpion2 - this changes a couple of RGB matrix effects to respect the sat and val variables.
- Display firmware size percentage ([#6307](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6307)) by fauxpark - this displays percentage used of firmware, in addition to the byte count used. Useful for quick referencing.
- Switching rgb_config_t to use HSV struct ([#5933](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5933)) by Xulkal/XScorpion2 - this switches the config to using the HSV structure, which allows for a number of code optimizations to be performed.
- Update docker util script and travis to use new base container ([#6071](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6071)) by zvecr - Enjoy smaller downloads with the new slim image.
- Add GPL3 header to avr i2c files ([#6332](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6332)) by drashna
- QMK CLI and JSON keymap support ([#6176](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6176)) by skullydazed - this starts to add a powerful and easy to use CLI option for QMK! 
- Usbasploader bootloader option addition ([#6304](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6304)) by yiancar - adds “USBasp” bootloader type and target, to make flashing easier for these devices.
- add 'objs-size' target into tmk_core/avr.mk ([#5490](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5490)) by mtei - outputs detailed information about the compiled firmware, great for debugging and code optimization
- Sendstring LUT improvements ([#5727](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5727)) by fauxpark - overhaul to the sendstring code
- Skip unsupported firmware check message in silent mode ([#5765](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5765)) by drashna - this removes the “firmware check not supported” message when silence is enabled. This also means that Travis will no longer display this message when compiling all default keymaps (making the output cleaner).
- Add out of bound check for Leader Key sequence array ([#5840](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5840)) by drashna - fixes bug that crashes the controller when hitting more than 5 keys in a leader sequence. 
- shell.nix: Downgrade gcc-arm-embedded ([#5913](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5913)) by rvolosatovs - downgrades the arm gcc binary for shell.nix
- Adding rgb matrix speed into eeprom storage. ([#5965](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5965)) by Xulkal/XScorpion2 - This moves the rgb matrix speed setting into EEPROM, so it is properly persisted like the other settings. 
- Store backlight breathing state in EEPROM ([#6105](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6105)) by fauxpark - This stores the backlight breathing state into EEPROM so that it is properly persisted
- Configure Vagrant to use qmk_base_container ([#6194](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6194)) by zvecr - This changes Vagrant to use the QMK container, reproducing the Travis CI build environment.
- Make Caps Lock delay more reasonable ([#6199](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6199)) by drashna - drops the default for the caps lock delay back down to 80ms, which should much more reasonable
- Expand bootloader target to support most AVR boards ([#6255](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6255)) by drashna - Now the `:bootloader` target can be used for at90usb1286 boards, as well as 8MHz Pro Micros, and other boards! 
- Add ARM I2Cv1 support to i2c_master ([#6262](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6262)) by zvecr - Allows OLED support for bluepill boards.
- Align ARM i2c_readReg with AVR ([#6314](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6314)) by zvecr - brings the ARM i2c API in line with what AVR has
- Allow Combo feature to be enabled/disabled live ([#6318](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6318)) by drashna - Allows for Combos to be disabled without recompiling.  Useful if you need to turn them off.
- Remove the need to specify NUM_OF_ENCODERS for the Encoder feature ([#6328](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6328)) by drashna - checks the size of the array rather than needing a hard coded value for the number of encoders. 
- Change `xprintf()` calls in rgblight.c to `dprintf()` ([#6363](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6363)) - by vomindoraan
- Add support for `TAP_CODE_DELAY` to Hold-Tap keys ([#5400](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5400)) by drashna
- Fix `MATRIX_X_PINS_RIGHT` ARM compliation ([#6395](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6395)) by zvecr
- Add config option for DIRECT_PINS_RIGHT ([#6479](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6479)) by gesinger - Adds support for different direct pin mappings on the halves of a split keyboard.



### Split Keyboard support for ARM based boards

There has been some more progress on this, lead mostly by zvecr, and a public project page added for the progress. Check it out [here](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/projects/2). If you want to contribute, or have a collection of split keyboards ready for testing, hop on over to [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/Uq7gcHh).

## QMK Toolbox Updates

### 0.0.11 released
- [macOS] Fix permission issues with dfu-util
- [macOS] Fix loading file:// paths with spaces
- [macOS] Fix libusb and add libftdi to get avrdude flashing without homebrew formulae
- [macOS] Ignore bluetooth modems (properly flash with avrdude)
- [Windows] Update BootloadHID.exe (hopefully prevent false positives)
- [Windows] Fix avrdude command for usbasp devices

### Known issues:
* [All] EEPROM flashing may have issues.  If you run into this issue, grab the old [hex eeprom reset file](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/blob/3d7c9b4c32f1bb7db49e4b0c2a65859fca20bd27/common/atmega32u4_eeprom_reset.hex).  You'll need to flash that, and then flash your firmware. 
* [Windows] If drivers are not properly installed, it may cause an error on startup, if device is already in bootloader mode.  Install drivers from [qmk driver installer repo](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_driver_installer) or [Zadig](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/faq_build?id=unknown-device-for-dfu-bootloader) to prevent. 
* [Windows] BootloadHID may still be picked up as a virus.  It's a false positive, because of the nature of the utility.
