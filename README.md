# QMK Monthly

New issues need to be put into the `/_issues/` folder with a filename of the format `YYYY-DD-MM.md` and the following header at the beginning of the file, without `# QMK Monthly ...` typically used in the reddit posts:

```md
---
layout: default
title:  "QMK Monthly, Issue <number>"
---

<content>
```
